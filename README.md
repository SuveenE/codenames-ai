# Codenames AI 

### I got OpenAI o1 to play Codenames and it's super good.

Will be sharing the interesting results I found on a blog post soon.

New to Codenames? Here's a 3-minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WErB95Brgbs) explaining how it works.

Features

- See AI play a game with random words
- See AI play a game with a custom set of words and a custom board (If you just finished playing a game, see how AI would have played it)
- Replay previous games ( Currently this is suppored only for a test game )

## The story behind

During our lunch breaks, my colleagues and I have been enjoying games of Codenames. In one round, the clue giver faced the challenge of connecting "carrot" and "ray." At the end of the game, I asked ChatGPT for a suggestion, and it came up with "Orange", a pretty clever clue! My own idea was "Laser."

That got me thinking: how good could AI be at playing Codenames? So, I built this.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
