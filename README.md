## The story behind 

During our lunch breaks, my colleagues and I have been enjoying games of Codenames. In one round, the clue giver faced the challenge of connecting "carrot" and "ray." At the end of the game, I asked ChatGPT for a suggestion, and it came up with "Orange"â€”a pretty clever clue! My own idea was "Laser."

That got me thinking: how good could AI be at playing Codenames? So, I built this.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
